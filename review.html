            <h2>A Review of the Current Literature</h2>
                <p>Mental illness onset or relapse is quite common in the perinatal period for women (Biaggi et al., 2016). In culture, a term commonly discussed within the context of mood disorders is Postpartum Depression, PPD, or even “baby blues”, the latter being used to describe a normal level of depressive symptoms in mothers (NIMH, 2020). However, diagnostic literature recognizes a wider onset period when it comes to depression that is associated with childbirth. The onset period for this mood disorder is any occurrence beginning during pregnancy (Segre & Davis, 2013). With this diagnostic change, postpartum depression, or Major Depressive Disorder with postpartum onset, can be more accurately be described in lay terms as peripartum depression. The terms peripartum and perinatal are commonly used interchangeably.</p>
                <p>While there is a variety of mood disorders that are classified within the perinatal period (Segre & Davis, 2013), the main focus of this review is on perinatal depression and anxiety. The difficulty being that the studies tend to be low risk and smaller sample size resulting in studies that are not always generalizable. Perinatal depression and anxiety can have a significant impact on a newborn. However, the treatment of different perinatal mood disorders has a variety of possibilities and current practices that show hope for those suffering from the disorders.</p> 

            <h3>Risk Factors</h3><br>
                <p>Multiples studies have found and confirmed that depression and anxiety tend to be higher during pregnancy than following childbirth. These findings were consistent in both mothers and fathers (Figueiredo & Conde, 2011 and Heron, et al., 2004). Anxiety and depression tends to peak with childbirth which is described as a normal pattern considering the level of change brought on by the event (Figueiredo & Conde, 2011). These changes in levels of depression and anxiety interact with each other and tend to precede any form of perinatal mood disorder (Biaggi et al., 2016). However, these changes in mood aren’t simply independent of outside factors.</p>
                <p>A review of multiple studies on risk factors for perinatal mood disorders found multiple predictors. These included lack of partner or social support, history of mental illness, adverse life experiences, high perceived stress, pregnancy complications or losses, unplanned/unwanted pregnancy, history of abuse, or low education or income status (Biaggi et al., 2016). Despite these additional predictors, it has still been found that the best predictor of peripartum mood disorders is the prior existence of anxiety or depressive disorder before pregnancy (Biaggi et al., 2016, Figueiredo & Conde, 2011, and Heron, et al., 2004).</p>  
            <h3>Negative Child Outcomes</h3><br>
                <p>Unfortunately, research has also found that there can be a negative impact on babies of mothers who experience perinatal depression and anxiety. The combination of the two disorders tends to have worse effects than anxiety or depression acting separately (Field et al., 2010). These two perinatal mood disorders can have a variety of immediate to more latent effects on an infant. Kane et al., Nolvi et al., and Descocio all researched these effects and found evidence that these effects were the result of anxiety or depression within or after pregnancy (2014, 2016, 2018).</p> 
                <p>Preterm birth, fearful child temperament, abnormal infant mental and psychomotor development, and brain morphology, or the physical development of the brain, have all been found to be affected by pregnancy anxiety (Kane et al., 2014). While much earlier research stated a result of intrauterine growth restriction of the infant as another adverse effects, it was contradicted in more recent research that supported the higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth when perinatal anxiety was experienced (Ibanez et al., 2012). Nolvi et al. further explored the idea that pregnancy anxiety results in adverse effects. They were able to find support for the effect of pregnancy specific anxiety, or anxiety related to issues regarding pregnancy, supporting evidence of negative emotional reactivity in infants (2016).</p>
                <p>Other research confirms this impact on fearful temperament as well as differences in emotional regulation and cognitive skills. However, there has even been research that has found a connection between prenatal stress and child hyperactivity and conduct problems such as Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (Descocio, 2018). The impact of perinatal anxiety and depression, as shown with this research, are not simply affecting the child early in infancy but beyond.</p>
                <p>However, the idea that anxiety can have a major effect on the human body is not necessarily unique to pregnancy. High cortisol levels are associated with physical stress on the body and can be associated with other issues because of stress. Kane et al. used this knowledge to assess the impact of pregnancy anxiety on the body in a more numerical analysis (2014). They found that pregnancy anxiety at high levels was associated with higher cortisol levels. Using the previous research on cortisol, this research shows the impact that anxiety can then have on the physiology of the mother and child going beyond the usual self report methods used (2014).</p>
            <h3>Treatment</h3><br>
                <p>Despite the discouraging statistics regarding the prevalence of Perinatal Depression and Anxiety, there is plenty of research on treatments for these disorders. As noted by the Postpartum Society International, “this disorder is temporary and treatable” (2020). There are many treatments listed, however not all of them are supported by research.</p>
                <p>Natural products, like omega-3 fatty acid, are among those with no evidence of benefit. This product actually produced a number of side effects whereas some treatments without benefits weren’t found to be harmful (Smith et al., 2019). Yoga, mindfulness, and relaxation were among those that were not harmful. Although there was no evidence within the depression scores, there were reports of client satisfaction and no side effects associated with them. There were three listed treatments that were helpful but only for specific aspects of the disorders and one which found physiological changes associated with anxiety. Active relaxation techniques showed evidence of positive changes in mother’s physiological and cardiovascular state but did not directly change the mood disorders associated with those states (Urech et al., 2010). Acupuncture was found to reduce a small number of women reporting postpartum depression but not a reduction in women reporting less symptoms. Massage was found to reduce antenatal depression but had no impact on anxiety. Bright light therapy was found to change some aspects of antenatal depression including difficulty with sleep, showing benefit for disturbed sleep (Smith et al., 2019).</p>
                <p> Educational prenatal programs had mixed results concerning their effect on perinatal depression and anxiety. Those that concerned psychological health were found to mitigate the effect that financial stress and prior anxiety and depression had on birth outcomes (Feinberg et al., 2016). However, general prenatal education nor high or low amounts of feedback on ultrasounds provided benefits related to the mothers anxiety or depression (Nabhan & Aflaifel, 2015). In considering all the treatment options, the most beneficial treatment or intervention is one that uses evidence based psychological strategies focusing on mental health (Gajaria & Ravindran, 2018).</p>
                <p>This intervention is more commonly done in a community or home setting which tends to be the preference by mothers. The interventions should be focused on maternal mental health as those that focused on infant health had no impact (Gajaria & Ravindran, 2018). While these interventions work well for high income countries, it becomes a more difficult question for low to middle income countries. Gajaria and Ravindran suggest working with mothers in their home environment in these situations and mixing maternal mental health care in with infant care (2018). Another suggestion could be non-text-based learning.</p>  
                <p>Despite the risk factors and impact on mother and child, there are treatments for perinatal depression and anxiety. The research on perinatal depression and anxiety spans across the globe and varies in the specific questions being asked. Many of these studies are producing important information. However, the lack of generalizable research is a crutch. Despite the wide variety, many individual studies utilize small and relatively homogenous samples that reduce the generalizability. Additionally, as Gajaria and Ravindran suggest, more research into lower and middle income countries would be highly beneficial to understanding this mood disorder. More reviews of literature, or studies with larger, more heterogenous samples, would be a great direction for this area of study.</p>
