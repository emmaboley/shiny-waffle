                While often underdiagnosed and unidentified, postpartum depression is a relatively well-known term associated with pregnancy and childbirth. However, less common is the discussion of depression and anxiety during as well as after pregnancy. This temporary and treatable disorder can be referred to as perinatal or peripartum depression.

                According to Postpartum Support International, perinatal depression and anxiety is identified by signs and symptoms of the disorder. These are assessed using self-report surveys, but a diagnosis must come from a medical provider. One of the more common measures of perinatal depression is the EPDS or Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Postpartum Society International, 2020). Some symptoms of perinatal depression may include` persistent sad or anxious mood, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, trouble bonding or forming emotional attachment with newborn (National Institute of Mental Health, 2020).

                    Perinatal depression and anxiety can have a negative impact on not only the mother but also the newborn. Studies have found that perinatal anxiety and depression can result in preterm birth, impaired mental and psychomotor development, impaired physical brain development, and a more fearful temperament. Preterm birth was found to be most common when the mother experienced anxiety in addition to depression during pregnancy. These mood disorders can also affect bonding between mother and infant, feeding, and childhood weight problems.

                    However, perinatal mood disorders is an active research field where different treatments are being discussed and tested. While certain activities are said to have an impact on perinatal depression and anxiety, the research does not support the use of yoga, mindfulness, relaxation, acupuncture, massage, or bright light therapy for treating it. However, they all had minor to no side effects so are not considered to have a negative impact. The most important thing to remember is to speak with your Healthcare Provider about what your best options are. Generally, the most beneficial intervention for perinatal anxiety or depression is going to be psychological interventions that are evidence based and focus on mental health. This can be done in community or home settings as well as in clinical or individual settings. In area where maternal mental health may be stigmatized, it may be beneficial to incorporate this mental health care in with infant care by coming into the home to where the mothers live.

                     Difficulty with much of the research is the lack of generalizability within independent studies. While there are a variety of studies done in a variety of places around the world, all tend to have somewhat homogenous samples. More studies that are more generalizable would be a beneficial direction for research.
